# Naughts-Crosses_Assembly
A simple implementation of naughts and crosses written in x86_64 linux assembly

This was merely a practice problem as a first experiment in working in x86_64 assembly

There are no checks on the input nor on whether X or O have won

The input should be within the range of 1-3 for X and Y, no space in between and 11 is top left corner
